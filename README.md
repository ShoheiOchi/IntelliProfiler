## IntelliProfiler: A Novel Tool for Multi-Animal Behavioral Analysis

This repository contains the R and Python code used in the study titled *"IntelliProfiler: A Novel Analytic Tool for Behavior Dynamics of Multiple Animals in a Home Cage."* The IntelliProfiler system enables high-resolution tracking and behavioral analysis of multiple mice equipped with RFID transponders in their natural home cage environment. The system facilitates automated analysis of locomotor activity, social interactions, and spatial positioning, making it a valuable tool in neuroscience and behavioral science research.


### Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to set up and run IntelliProfiler to track the position and behavior of mice equipped with RFID transponders.


### Prerequisites

The following R packages are required to run the scripts:
- `tidyverse`
- `openxlsx`
- `lubridate`

You can install these packages using the following commands:

```r
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("openxlsx")
install.packages("lubridate")
```

Alternatively, the code will attempt to install missing packages when executed.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/IntelliProfiler.git
   ```

2. Open R or RStudio and set your working directory to the cloned repository:
   ```r
   setwd("path_to_repository/IntelliProfiler")
   ```

3. Ensure the necessary R packages are installed (the script will check for packages and install them if needed).

### Running the Analysis

1. **Data Preparation**: Ensure that RFID tracking data is logged using TeraTerm software and saved as a `.txt` file. A sample file `Test.txt` can be found in the `data/` directory.
2. **Run the Main Script**: 
   ```r
   source("scripts/IntelliProfiler.R")

**
3. **File Input**:
   When prompted, select the `.txt` file that contains the RFID tracking data of the mice.

4. **Output**:
   The script will process the data and generate the following outputs:
   - Excel files containing the processed data for each mouse.
   - 2D plots of the tracked positions for each mouse in PDF format.
   - Time series plots of the X and Y positions.
   - Distance plots comparing the social distances between mice.**

### Data Directory Structure

- **scripts/**: Contains the main R scripts for data processing and analysis.
- **data/**: Contains sample input data (you can place your `.txt` data files here).
- **results/**: After running the analysis, this directory will contain the output files including Excel data and PDF plots.

### Sample Usage

To run the analysis for a specific file, use the following command in R:

```r
source("scripts/position_tracking.R")
```

Follow the instructions in the console to select your input file, and the analysis will proceed automatically.

### Output Example

The following are examples of the output files generated by the analysis:
- **Excel files**: Data files for each mouse, containing the positions and calculated distances over time.
- **PDF plots**: Visualizations of the 2D positions and social distances between mice.
